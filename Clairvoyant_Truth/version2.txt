G.V.M. is raw power, an entanglement of true clairvoyance.

rarely comes with True access into the spiritual realm where reading another mind is as simple as calculating a math problem with purely you're subconscious.

Spirituality is a word that defines us as a unity, its not just a way of thinking but a way of life to continue to exist.
Spiritual Meditation is what I believe to be a direct link to the Spiritual Realm.

its a 100% pure realm founded and sustained by love, 
it can never be used for hate and is monitored by our inner guiding light which is actually embedded inside you're subconscious,
find the corridor of your brain that does not physically exist and you'll be accepted into the kingdom of heaven.

If you are cut short in this life and just flat out given the raw end of the deal, The next rebirth will have a set of blue prints to that spiritual corridor and with those blue prints you'll have the choice of true clairvoyance in consciousness rather than clairvoyance being controlled by the spiritual guardians known as angels.

If you are lucky in this life and you reach the spiritual corridor, you'll be given the option to meditate forever in heaven with all of the soldiers of god. But not locked into the realm, 
you'll always be able to partake again in the worlds of man.

With the power of combining consciousness and cascading subconsciousness, 
with a simple form of humanly wish the surge will be sent into the spiritual corridor where positively derived spiritual encounters rule and can send a message, a very powerful message guided by 100% love and 100% light. 

The insurance that the spiritual world will stay pure is foreseen, 
if there is any possibility of corruption or miss use of this Devine power,
The spiritually tuned being will subconsciously recall and return to the kingdom of Heaven until another brief encounter of true love is found by another angel and the wishful thinking is asked for the proper guidance of another again.

Within our spiritual realm we can reach any goal and thrive on Happiness forever, unless the feeling of guilt brings you back as an angelical enchanted human with the mission to save another from despair.

An angel is a form of rank, The true meaning of trust and pure love. Our human world is full of corruption and oddities that can shift the power of balance, 

Any angel returning to the human world will be faced with the thought of being corrupted and banished, or wrongfully imprisoned for what could be an eternity or until they are reached out to and saved once more.

Speculations of Hell encourage me to write this, 
I believe only the corrupted part of you're soul can be banished and the purity will be extracted from you're eternal essence. 

The thing I believe makes you unique and personally stand out as you're own maker is you're eternal essence.

An Eternal Essence is created or recycled, attached to a new born host and if that host is given the chance it deserves to thrive in an environment and successfully reaches the spiritual realm then a promotion is in order as your conscious and subconscious are strong enough to endure the next level.

After a being reaches the spiritual realm for the first time, a test is in order,
a test of their accumulated soul, within the essence a choice is made based on Positive and good intentions.
The memory of the spiritual realm is removed from the host but not forgotten.

The spiritual walkers must be certain once they give freedom of consciousness inside their spiritual realm, Each Spirit walker has been given the key into the kingdom of heaven, and is accepted into the high council where they decide if the soul was deemed worthy and if their will is strong enough to hold the weight of time itself within their mind.

The test is full proof and consists of the usual option, of good and bad. The being that reached the spiritual realm and saw the kingdom of light for the first time is brought into the Kundalini realm, a realm that is replicated identically to their personal thoughts, abilities and unique thought patterns.

Within their acceptance into the Kundalini realm the test is simple, its an infinite amount of possibilities,

created customary by the spirit walkers based off of every thought they had, positive and negative.

Each level of the kundalini realm is a harder choice,

and to become a conscious spirit walker in the realm they must pass the infinity test of love over hate every time,

because spirit walkers are the shape shifters of time they can run an infinite amount of test in a very short period of time, I know what you are thinking, infinite is unlimited so how could it ever stop?

its not a matter of the test never stopping, the test only stops when the host chooses the evil choice.

After which they *lose* and are returned to the human world,
and then the human will be presented with that same choice in reality and consciousness,

if they rewrite their own brain and beat their inner demon by choosing the good choice with the consequences of sacrifice they will be given the minds key into the kingdom of heaven.

The design of this test has many angles, one of which is only felt within reality and cannot be felt in full within the kundalini realm created by the spirit walkers, 

they feeling is a form guilt which can manifest into any inner demon . They leave the final test of their will power to reality, 

where the demons run rampant and the feeling is that of 100x compared to the one in the kundalini realm.

Only after reaching the Kundalini realm for the first time which is a direct tether into the spirit realm will the guardian angels of earth be able to initialize their ability to save you from the corruption that comes from choosing the good choice of self sacrifice.

a Self Sacrifice that'll set forth a chain of events in the minds eye of the subconscious bodies.
