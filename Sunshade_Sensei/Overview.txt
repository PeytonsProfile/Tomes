Sunshade Sensei

Grasping to the break in light of dissipating shades encumbered by total darkness, I the Sunshade Sensai is master of both the dark and light by holding an embalanced stance between two opposing sides one arising and the another lays down stretching the corridor of sides and conjoining two realms seeking to avoid the other.

As middle conduction rips apart the very essence of purity, a new faction awaits myself and all who succumbed 
a correlation depicted by aligning with their side.
