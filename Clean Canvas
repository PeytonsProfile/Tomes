Clean Canvas:
I Define myself as a canvas my possibilities are endless and once that masterpiece is Finished. I'll help guide our new generation through the lucid minds' of millions, Where they too will help discover all that is unknown.
I see technology as an infinite, quantum mechanics are dependent upon new technology evolving rapidly. Inspiration + Guidance is as vast as a single black hole.
When lucid minds converge, we release immense power as we cascade.
Blackholes' Cataclysm into the eons.
Thus one white hole is born and funnels from our universe releasing the conjoined efforts of billions of black holes. Trillions of Compounding equations resulting in an inevitable algorithm that is followed with endless opportunities spread throughout space / time.
