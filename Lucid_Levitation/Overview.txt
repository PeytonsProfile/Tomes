Lucid Levitation

As I rise, controlled by lucid adaption my physical body conjoins with my thought, and my lucid reality.
A surge or energy conjured from countless light years away, gaining momentum amongst travel faster than all light, a concentration algorithm used to filter impurities begins to push from under and pull from the top, this gravitational aura allows entrance into the spiritual realm if allowed to pass, only the soul and its conscious abilities see into extravagant portals placed throughout space and time.
