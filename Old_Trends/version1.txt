Old Trends:

Sometimes the world just contains our essence and utilizes out findings for its own need, Imagine only having a mind no body, just the ability to sense and ponder under the scope of an oblivion.
Wondering if the world is alive and conscious seems pointless, I could say mother-nature is just a myth or fairy tale we tell to pass the time and ease the burden of an always curious brain.
I won't though, nature is alive we are conjured from the same materials of the mind of god and body of matter, this includes trees, minerals and metals.
The will of a higher being cannot sense as you and I unless within the kundalini tether where the dead-spectres can walk amongst man within their shoes.
Every element is alive, even the cold kind without greenery, Sure a stone does think allegedly and neither does a tree. But the third eye of god can present the impossible as commonly logical.
Every different element has its own deity, when you disrespect that element you'll begin a hairline fracture beneath the lucid element known for euphoria.
Blessed be the land on which we stand, sacred be the air we breathe, gently and forcefully abundant air needs stone just as oxygen needs water, without stone we wouldn't exist. Amongst the rebirth of all essences is a new trend awaiting more resources to begin.
Old beliefs are not ones I preach.
