1. PDFS finoshed
2. Add correlating download links. Via HTML OF .PDF FILES TO BUTTONS
2.1 ADD beta notice to read out videos to get users to polish typos, not understandable text to speech and content additions. Let them know how to polish a video, or they can send a time link of when the youtube video needs to be fixed.

3. Add sticky Accordion navbar, landing page has to be a login, or a signup login button needs to be on the header navbar, after logged in swaps to signout. Launching without logins first
4. Sticky navfooter [vids][Inquisitor][ToA][Donate]

MVP ^^^

 v2 API needs to store data, so an account is needed? merge v1 & v2
10. Look into dynamic filtering for MI, FO, HC, VI, RE
Filling out accordion and modal information for basic Classical ex. A.A. will add modal for A.A. additions, and seperate PDF download for each file, along with a compiled download all PDF
(((make content idea of randomizer on hold: v2 now)))

do I dev on local to test or wtf? I think js bin to get the code working and then implement a db with compiled code, use CDN on jsbin to test. push to heroku only when the code is structured w/cdn and then start same method of pdf download, copy paste code and zip and archive only open a duplicate, save file to phone and laptop

remember to Add download pdfs to server, Make API for PDFS v1

node db drop or wipe the app

finish accordion finish modal

add content in modal and run a 3 / mo SEO modal check for content rendered

Run 1 day analysis, and 3 day ({Target keywords.}]

add [Zen], pull to next file, as [Pass]. Jump through To second AA as 1.1 on accordion? or read more on modal?

Prioritize, Pass is not a necessity, look into adding image to modal as table of contents, and suggest command+F to find.

fit 20k words, with 5K oversights on each as the Modal Overview 26x200 5.2k char

20k is target size fit recheck sources

look into mocha on server to client testing

use only 1 Jquery install try without CDN, Polish file By adding ONLY! modal and accordion file.

Use seperate nav bar file look into Mobile side nav, and make sure to import said files without CDN
