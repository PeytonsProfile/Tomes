1. PDFS finished
2. 
2. Add correlating download links. Finished
2.1 ADD beta notice to read out videos to get users to polish typos, not understandable text to speech and content additions. Let them know how to polish a video, or they can send a time link of when the youtube video needs to be fixed.
2.2 Do Audio readout to youtube for music quality, add download link in modal, and follow to video link.

3. make banners, need to draw up custom backgrounds, not words and letters.
4. nav Header [vids][Inquisitor][ToC][Contributor] <<< for BetaTesters, Partially Finished
5. Make 26 Videos, Add correlating vid links, youtube embedded page. Not going to use an embedded youtube page, just a channel. Eventually videos will just be in a custom audio file, use youtube time sync for beta assistance, and make sure youtube audio has a time sync for sharing and etc.
6. Make Custom Banners, under Modals AA 1.0, 1.1 and etc.
7. Make custom Homepage banner.
8. Add google voice page search on headnav bar, added need to get working in scaffold, works on http://codepen.io/peytoncaseria/pen/NxeKQq
9. Inquisitor, v1 predicts and suggests which story the user should view, which then uses href download to specified file, if their answered are jumbled sends to download all.
10. make Each Layer AA - ZZ have color attributes that carefully change in tone, make the letters have color and then the accordion bars bright light colors, and then the letters to be darker, have them match the banners.
MVP ^^^

 v2 API needs to store data, so an account is needed? merge v1 & v2
10. Look into dynamic filtering for MI, FO, HC, VI, RE
Filling out accordion and modal information for basic Classical ex. A.A. will add modal for A.A. additions, and seperate PDF download for each file, along with a compiled download all PDF
(((make content idea of randomizer on hold: v2 now)))

do I dev on local to test or wtf? I think js bin to get the code working and then implement a db with compiled code, use CDN on jsbin to test. push to heroku only when the code is structured w/cdn and then start same method of pdf download, copy paste code and zip and archive only open a duplicate, save file to phone and laptop

remember to Add download pdfs to server, Make API for PDFS v1

node db drop or wipe the app

finish accordion finish modal

add content in modal and run a 3 / mo SEO modal check for content rendered

Run 1 day analysis, and 3 day ({Target keywords.}]

add [Zen], pull to next file, as [Pass]. Jump through To second AA as 1.1 on accordion? or read more on modal?

Prioritize, Pass is not a necessity, look into adding image to modal as table of contents, and suggest command+F to find.

fit 20k words, with 5K oversights on each as the Modal Overview 26x200 5.2k char

20k is target size fit recheck sources

look into mocha on server to client testing

use only 1 Jquery install try without CDN, Polish file By adding ONLY! modal and accordion file.

Use seperate nav bar file look into Mobile side nav, and make sure to import said files without CDN
